Hands on data science materials for ASOs

This repository is a collection of resources for hands-on practice of data science fundamentals. I will do my best to credit the sources of content or inspiration for the content.

The primary focus will be creating a jupyter notebook environment to allow for the application of Python and possibly R or other scripting languages and tools to manipulate, describe and visualize data.
