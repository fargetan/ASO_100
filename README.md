# ASO_100
## Hands on data science materials for ASOs
***

This repository is a collection of resources for hands-on practice of data science fundamentals. I will do my best to credit the sources of content or inspiration for the content. The primary source for most of the data and the notebook content is [here, at Skipper Seabold's 2018 PyCon GitHub repository](https://github.com/jseabold/pycon-ds-2018 "Introduction to Python for Data Science for PyCon 2018"). There is also an accompanying video of his presentation on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4WQi2OIy7o "Skipper Seabold - Introduction to Python for Data Science - PyCon 2018")

The primary focus will be creating a jupyter notebook environment to allow for the application of Python and possibly R or other scripting languages and tools to manipulate, describe and visualize data.

## How to use this repository from anywhere
Mybinder.org allows you to spin up the Jupyterlab environment and run the notebooks in the repository.
[Open this repository at mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fargetan/ASO_100/HEAD)

Alternatively you could clone this to your computer and host the notebooks locally, perhaps using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)
